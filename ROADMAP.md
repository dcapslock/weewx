# Roadmap

NB: These are _potential_ projects. Nothing has been set in stone.

Refactor tests:
- Use [`pytest`](https://pytest.org).
- Allow tests to run in parallel.

Optional new plot generator
- Candidate would be [`plotly.py`](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py)

New, more interactive skin.
- Highcharts style
- Possibly real-time

Support for running more than one driver.
- Would require asynchronous drivers.

`weectl upload` - analogous to `weectl import`, but in reverse. It would upload
to the various RESTful services offered by restx.

Update the fousb driver.
